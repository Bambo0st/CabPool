credentials :"include" specifies that you send the cookies from frontend to backend
This you need to do when you are in cross origin
But you need not mention this if you are using vite proxy as they will belong to same domain and automatically send cookies.


docker ps
docker logs <container-name>
vite-preview default port is 4173
You need --host 0.0.0.0 because the client and backend are eaching running on their own containers and are communicating through service
but if you want to see in the host system u have to set host 0.0.0.0 that means it wont listen only to localhost anymore and evey incoming connections with same port.
The above is the case for Vite. whereas for backend they always listen on 0.0.0.0, thats why if you do localhost:3000 inside the host system you will get the backend page/

If you add --host to vite run dev/start, then u can open your website from phone too(use ur local ip address:port).


Jest:
npm install --save-dev jest @testing-library/react @testing-library/jest-dom
minikube start --extra-config=apiserver.authorization-mode=RBAC

minikue didnt work, shifted to k3s
the config file is diff for k3s,make sure to use appropriate export, have to give 644 permission for k3s config file


NodePort makes it such that I can access the website from Windows too. <Zorrin_VM_IP>:<NODE_PORT>. http://192.168.0.111:30000/
For getting Zorrin_VM_IP: run (ip a) and find the enp0s3.

kubectl get pods
kubectl logs <pod-name>
